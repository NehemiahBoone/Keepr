Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share and discover new interests by posting images or videos that can be "kept" in a collection by those who like the content.

> A collection(`vault`) of posts(`keeps`) with a common theme. 

Users can view the profiles of other users to see
- The users name and profile image
- Their public collection of `vaults`
- `Keeps` the user has created
- If a `vault` is private, all users other than the creator are unable to see the vault.
